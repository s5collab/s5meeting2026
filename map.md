**Getting to Macquarie University City Campus** (level 24/123 Pitt St, Sydney NSW 2000)

The **Macquarie University City Campus** is right in the middle of Sydney’s CBD and is easy to reach by public transport. It’s only a short walk from **Wynyard**, **Town Hall**, and **Martin Place** train stations, all served by multiple train and the metro lines. There are also plenty of bus routes nearby if you’re coming from other parts of the city. If you’re arriving from **Sydney Airport**, the train is usually the easiest option. Take the Airport Link to **Town Hall** or **Wynyard**, then follow the signs or walk a few minutes to the campus. A taxi or rideshare will take around 20–30 minutes from the airport, depending on traffic. Once you arrive, there will be signs in the building and staff around to help you find your way.

Note: Drink reception on Monday 5:30 pm at Macquarie main campus [location here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZsQiFJr92cafxhuy9).
