Sydney has plenty to offer, whether you are staying a bit longer before/after the meeting. We’ve put together a **Google Doc with recommendations** for things to do, places to eat, and points of interest around the city and near the campus, as well as practical information about **public transport**, **getting around**, and **useful tips** for visitors.

The guide includes suggestions for:
- Local cafes, restaurants, and casual dining spots
- Walks, beaches, and scenic areas
- Museums, galleries, and cultural highlights
- How to use Sydney’s trains, metro, buses, and ferries
You can access the full guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xSbYJTcWo2sklTtgVrhB9fwUVoHrsypB015_956RPcs/edit?usp=sharing).

Feel free to explore at your own pace, and don’t hesitate to ask the organisers if you’d like any local tips during the meeting. We hope that you can enjoy your time at Sydney!
