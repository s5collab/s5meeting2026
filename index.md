We are happy to announce our upcoming Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5) Collaboration Meeting 2026, which will take place at the Macquarie University City Campus (in the Sydney CBD, Australia) from 2–4 February 2026. This meeting will bring together researchers from across the S5 collaboration to share our recent results, discuss ongoing work, and explore new opportunities for the collaboration – and for new collaborators! – including planning the transition to the forthcoming OzArch project. A detailed schedule and logistical information can be found on this website. The atmosphere will be welcoming and informal, with a program covering scientific talks, open discussion sessions, and plenty of opportunities for interaction.

We have also planned a visit to Siding Spring Observatory (SSO) from 5–8 February 2026. Please note that on-site accommodation at SSO is very limited; however, additional options are available in Coonabarabran, approximately a 30-minute drive from the observatory. Transport may be arranged depending on interest and logistics. Further details about the trip will be shared once participants outside S5 are confirmed.

We hope you will join us in Sydney and contribute to an engaging and enjoyable meeting.
